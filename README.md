# NFT-names
This is a simple script that generates all possible combinations of first and last names based on U.S. Census data. This file has then been minted in an NFT on the blockchain so I own it.

## Why did you do this
I inherently understand NFTs and have found a loophole that allows me to own all possible names, therefore if you haven't already minted your name on the blockchain. I own it.

## What can I do with this script
Nothing, do not run this script, doing so will generate a file with all names that I own, this constitutes theft. The blockchain doesn't lie, even if you run this script, I own it, it's mine.
